So the server I have hosted at Dacentec is starting to show its age and limitations. Luckily I can get my hands on some decent hardware thanks to ebay and other methods. So the past few days when time allows I have been working on building a replacement 1u server to what I currently have. In doing so I am taking the RAM from 16GB to 196GB. With that said the system is installed with a stock ubuntu 17.10 server using guided lvm partitioning. Which thinks like days of old where total ram equals the swap size needed.

Avoiding the whole debate of how much swap would be ideal. I am just going to scale it back to about 16GB. Thus freeing up about 80% of the OS RAID 1 drives.

As always google and a stackoverflow/askubuntu (Ref links below) along with some good old fashion thinking.
