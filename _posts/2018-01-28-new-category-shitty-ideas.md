So I have some ideas from time to time that I tend to forget or deem to crappy to execute. So I figure I would at least write them down as sometimes the crappy ideas will still bear a fruit of some sort. Thus I will write them crib note style and password protect them with the password “shitty idea”. This way they do not get indexed by search engines but still allow the random visitor to view the idea.
