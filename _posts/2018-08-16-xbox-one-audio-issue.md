So the girlfriend and I just tried to watch an episode of Stargate SG-1 on DVD on the Xbox One. During playback we have an interesting audio issue. We heard more background sounds than speech. A short Google search later and the problem was resolved.

To solve this we simply had to open settings, go to display and sound. From there edit the audio output from 7.1 surround to stereo. I think this is the simplest to date of problems that I have run into.
