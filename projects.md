I have a small list of ideas I dont want to forget but not sure if I will ever get to them.

- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CSS Grid</span> WordPress theme, possibly similar to 2014 theme
- Modify a garage door opener to allow an external source button push. 
    - Home security system displaced this project as it is now a thing with it.
- Misc things for dump1090 
    - Rewrite of the dump1090 interface again, I never published my new layout. 
        - [ ![](https://i.imgur.com/r72XYu0.png)](https://i.imgur.com/r72XYu0.png)
    - A script to convert dump1090 data in to a KML file that google earth can consume to show in a 3d space where planes are.
    - A “helper” site that offers up the navigation points &amp; pathing for approch/departure
