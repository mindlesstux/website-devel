This is for the people that scrape data from my dump1090-fa install that I have proxied.

What do you need to do to get the data? Simply have your project when requesting data to send a user agent string that contains a URL to the location where I can see how my data is being consumed/used. Is that really so much to ask?

What I will do to anyone not providing user agent data:

- actively block use of my data at my amusement
- provide junk data only again at my amusement
- have you consume 10mb+ garbage files
