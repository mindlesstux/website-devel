## TODO Still:

- Make it sticky across reboots
- Make it toggle
- Make it trigger on spawn and when ever player triggers weapon/ammo pickup 
    - May need to just go with a timer of every second or something.

## Known Issues:

- No simple way to toggle off
- Player can restock and get weapons back

## Version History:

### 0.0.1

- Initial release of the plugin
