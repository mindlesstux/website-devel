Some time ago [Cloudflare opened up tunneling traffic](https://blog.cloudflare.com/tunnel-for-everyone/) from origin servers to theirs negating the need for nat punches or breaking out the credit card. This is great for say home use or someone behind a cg-nat that wants to self-host. Not so good for solving gaming issues. I found that you can run their software fairly easily on most systems but I have had one nagging thing that I wanted to try. I finally sat down and figured some of it out. I wanted to run the [docker container of cloudflared.](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudflare/cloudflared) My problem has been that there has been kinda poor documentation on the how to get it going. Not saying it does not exist, itâ€™s just not obvious on the steps. Today I will demystify some of this below:

### Prep System

I tend to store anything on the host and use a host volume. So this is what I personally do to prep containers.

```
<pre class="line-numbers">```bash
mkdir -p /docker-store/cloudflared/.cloudflared
chmod 777 /docker-store/cloudflared/
chmod 777 /docker-store/cloudflared/.cloudflared/
```
```

### Run the container once to login

```bash
$ docker run -v /docker-store/cloudflared/.cloudflared:/home/nonroot/.cloudflared/ cloudflare/cloudflared:2022.1.0 tunnel login

### Launch the tunnel

```bash
# docker run --name cloudflare-argo -v /docker-store/cloudflared/.cloudflared:/etc/cloudflared cloudflare/cloudflared:2022.1.0 tunnel --no-autoupdate --name mtg-asdf --hostname mtg-asdf-argo.mindlesstux.com --url http://172.16.10.235:80 
Tunnel credentials written to /etc/cloudflared/238b98cc-e7a7-495d-95eb-a407bf671cbc.json. cloudflared chose this file based on where your origin certificate was found. Keep this file secret. To revoke these credentials, delete the tunnel.

### Test the new url

Test to make sure it works by browsing the hostname supplied to cloudflared.
