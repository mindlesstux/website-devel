Some time ago [Cloudflare opened up tunneling traffic](https://blog.cloudflare.com/tunnel-for-everyone/) from origin servers to theirs negating the need for nat punches or breaking out the credit card. This is great for say home use or someone behind a cg-nat that wants to self-host. Not so good for solving gaming issues. I found that you can run their software fairly easily on most systems but I have had one nagging thing that I wanted to try. I finally sat down and figured some of it out. I wanted to run the [docker container of cloudflared.](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudflare/cloudflared) My problem has been that there has been kinda poor documentation on the how to get it going. Not saying it does not exist, it’s just not obvious on the steps. Today I will demystify some of this below:

### Prep System

I tend to store anything on the host and use a host volume. So this is what I personally do to prep containers.

```
<pre class="line-numbers">```bash
mkdir -p /docker-store/cloudflared/.cloudflared
chmod 777 /docker-store/cloudflared/
chmod 777 /docker-store/cloudflared/.cloudflared/
```
```

### Run the container once to login

```bash
$ docker run -v /docker-store/cloudflared/.cloudflared:/home/nonroot/.cloudflared/ cloudflare/cloudflared:2022.1.0 tunnel login

### Launch the tunnel

```bash
# docker run --name cloudflare-argo -v /docker-store/cloudflared/.cloudflared:/etc/cloudflared cloudflare/cloudflared:2022.1.0 tunnel --no-autoupdate --name mtg-asdf --hostname mtg-asdf-argo.mindlesstux.com --url http://172.16.10.235:80 
Tunnel credentials written to /etc/cloudflared/238b98cc-e7a7-495d-95eb-a407bf671cbc.json. cloudflared chose this file based on where your origin certificate was found. Keep this file secret. To revoke these credentials, delete the tunnel.

### Test the new url

Test to make sure it works by browsing the hostname supplied to cloudflared.
