So I got tired of looking at the theme that I had on this site, one of the wordpress out of the box from a few years ago. Out of curiosity I started browsing themes and I came across this one. It is called “[Blogstream](https://alx.media/themes/blogstream/)” by [Alexander Agnarson](http://alx.media/). I spent a little time tweaking the settings from the GUI but knew in a short time I would need to dig into the code for it to add some code for what I call “Reference URLs”. These are pages that I consulted about what I may have written. I just want to make sure they get the credit for part of my writing so I made it a custom field.

I liked how the tags look so I was hoping I could steal its CSS rather clumsily and have each URL be a little bubble. I also only wanted it to show on a full page of a post only. With those restrictions in mind after the break is the code to make it happen.

Easier to copy/paste code.

```
<pre class="line-numbers">```php
$mykey_values = get_post_custom_values('Reference_URL');
if(!empty($mykey_values)) {
    echo '<p class="post-tags"><span>Referenced URL/Sites:';
    foreach ( $mykey_values as $key => $value ) {
        echo "<a href=\"$value\">$value</a>";
    }
    echo '</span></p>';
}
```
