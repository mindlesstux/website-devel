Currently, I am writing a little series involving a product I recently discovered, [ZeroTier](https://zerotier.com/). Many people seem interested in how I am using it for personal use. So spending a few nights writing up my thoughts, the how toâ€™s, and grabbing some screenshots along the way.

Below is a bulleted list of post titles for the series.

- [Part 1: ZeroTier and making a multi-site LAN (MAN?)](https://mindlesstux.com/2018/09/23/zerotier-multsite-lan-part-1-zerotier-and-making-a-multi-site-lan-man/)
- [Part 2: Build the router VM(s)](https://mindlesstux.com/2018/09/23/zerotier-multsite-lan-part-2-build-the-router-vms/)
- [Part 3: Setup router to use the routing VM(s)](https://mindlesstux.com/2018/09/23/zerotier-multsite-lan-part-3-setup-router-to-use-the-routing-vms/)
- [Part 4: Test everything including breaking it!](https://mindlesstux.com/2018/12/07/zerotier-multsite-lan-part-4-test-everything-including-breaking-it/)
- [Part 5: Bonus! Use ZeroTier as mobile VPN.](https://mindlesstux.com/2018/12/07/part-5-bonus-use-zerotier-as-mobile-vpn/)
- Part 6: Double Bonus! Configure anycast pihole DNS

I hope this is a nice little list of topics/points that will cover the subject well. Once I have all the core parts written I will post them all back to back (minutes apart) and link them here as well.
