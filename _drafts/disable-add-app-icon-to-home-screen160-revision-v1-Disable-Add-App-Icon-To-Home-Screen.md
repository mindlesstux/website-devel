The newer version of the play store on Android phones moved the check box from what I would call a ideal location to one that while makes sense is the last place I would check.

For my personal note and anyone that find this:

```
Home screen, press hold
Settings
Scroll to bottom, toggle 'Add icon to Home screen'
```
