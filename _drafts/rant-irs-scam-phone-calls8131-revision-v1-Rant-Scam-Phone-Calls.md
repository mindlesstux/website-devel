Normally I ignore these calls as they are the scum of the earth and don’t deserve my time. Today however I am expecting a call from a service tech from any possible phone number and thus I have to listen to any calls that come in today to make sure I don’t miss the call. Sadly this has me trolling through the voicemails that I just ignored entirely. I am just amazed that people fall for these types of calls all the time that makes these scams popular.

Here are some scam calls that hit my voicemail, so those that like to take revenge on them. Light them up on the phone system if they are still active.
