Just a little while ago I checked my [kuma status page](https://status.mindlesstux.com) and noted that several checks were failing. In troubleshooting, I found that at least the ping command had a problem.

```bash
$ ping www.google.com
ping: socket: Operation not permitted
```

Needless to say, this became rather annoying and off to google I went. I quickly found these [two](https://upwork.link/os_configs/centos-ping-socket-operation-not-permitted-for-usual-user/) [pages](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/EnableSysctlPingGroupRange) that described the problem and a fix for it. While I donâ€™t understand yet how the problem started on my system, I am glad I found a fix.

  
Verify this is the problem

```
<pre class="command-line" data-output="2,4">```bash
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ping_group_range 
1       0
ping www.google.com
ping: socket: Operation not permitted
```
```

First, create a file

```
<pre class="command-line">```bash
cd /usr/lib/sysctl.d
sudo vi 95-fix-ping-socket.conf
```
```

Contents of the new file

```markup
net.ipv4.ping_group_range = 0 2147483647
```

Kick sysctl to pick up the new settings

```
<pre class="command-line">```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-sysctl
```
```

Verify the fix is in place

```
<pre class="command-line" data-output="2,4-9">```bash
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ping_group_range 
0       2147483647
